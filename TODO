Resurrect Settings Class but in a friendlier way
Pull out global settings and make them readable/setable by users of the package
See if the basic structs like document, path etc etc can be used without settings
    -Make a clear distinction between modules dependant on settings and modules that are not

Cleanup api.__init__
Cleanup entire package so that import DTL does nothing
Cleanup/bullet proof package so GUI modules arn't loaded/crash when they don't have PyQT installed
   -Same goes for any/all external package dependancies
   
GUI CORE needs to be refactored/make less confusing
    -from DTL.gui import Core is confusing because it starts a PyQT app, but i think just going into DTL.gui should handle this
